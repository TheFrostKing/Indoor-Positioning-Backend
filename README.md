# Idoor-Positioning-Backend
This project is a backend service for indoor/outdoor positioning, built with Node.js and Express.js. It communicates with IoT hardware gateways that receive signals from tags and beacons, filters RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values, and provides APIs for location estimation via a trilateration service - part of University project.
